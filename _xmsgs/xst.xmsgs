<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="0" delta="new" >Part-select index evaluated to out of bound value may lead to incorrect synthesis results; it is recommended not to use them in RTL

<msg type="warning" file="HDLCompiler" num="1127" delta="new" >"C:\Users\Laboratorios\Desktop\HC05-Processor\hc05.vhd" Line 60: Assignment to <arg fmt="%s" index="1">display_7</arg> ignored, since the identifier is never used

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="3019" delta="new" >HDL ADVISOR - <arg fmt="%s" index="1">2048</arg> flip-flops were inferred for signal &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="2">ram8x8</arg>&gt;. You may be trying to describe a RAM in a way that is incompatible with block and distributed RAM resources available on Xilinx devices, or with a specific template that is not supported. Please review the Xilinx resources documentation and the XST user manual for coding guidelines. Taking advantage of RAM resources will lead to improved device usage and reduced synthesis time.

<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="647" delta="new" >Input &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">din&lt;7:0&gt;</arg>&gt; is never used. This port will be preserved and left unconnected if it belongs to a top-level block or it belongs to a sub-block and the hierarchy of this sub-block is preserved.
</msg>

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="1767" delta="new" >HDL ADVISOR - Resource sharing has identified that some arithmetic operations in this design can share the same physical resources for reduced device utilization. For improved clock frequency you may try to disable resource sharing.
</msg>

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="3218" delta="new" >HDL ADVISOR - The RAM &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">Mram_seg</arg>&gt; will be implemented on LUTs either because you have described an asynchronous read or because of currently unsupported block RAM features. If you have described an asynchronous read, making it synchronous would allow you to take advantage of available block RAM resources, for optimized device usage and improved timings. Please refer to your documentation for coding guidelines.

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="3231" delta="new" >The small RAM &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">Mram__n0246</arg>&gt; will be implemented on LUTs in order to maximize performance and save block RAM resources. If you want to force its implementation on block, use option/constraint ram_style.
